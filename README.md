# Udacity Deep Learning Engineer Nanodegree Course

This repo contains the work for the Deep Learning Engineer Nanodegree course on Udacity.  Each project will be partitioned into separate directories.

## Project #1 - Predicting Bike Sharing Patterns

The goal is to predict the total demand for bike rentals on a per hour basis given a curated set of features regarding weather, date, and the season.  This can be found in `Predict-Bike-Sharing-Patterns-Project-P1`.  The main notebook is in `Predict-Bike-Sharing-Patterns-Project-P1/Your_first_neural_network.ipynb` while the completed two-layer neural network implementation can be found in `Predict-Bike-Sharing-Patterns-Project-P1/my_answers.py`.

## Project #2 - Dog Classification Project

The goal is to predict the breed of dog given an image of one.  In addition, should a human be detected in the image, we output what the closest dog breed to that human would be in the image.  Please note that this project was already completed as part of my Machine Learning Engineer Capstone and can be found here: https://github.com/rayryeng/Udacity_Machine_Learning_Engineer_Nanodegree/tree/master/dog_breed_classification_capstone.  The same notebook and HTML render of the notebook was used for submission.  Please go to `Dog-Classification-Project-P2` for the notebook and HTML render.
